On comparing the predictions of temperature using both 
Hindu and Gregorian Calendars, it is observed that in the 
Hindu Calendar approach, the temperature variation has 
shown an identifiable pattern. The prediction model 
performed well and followed the actual trend in a better way.

Also, as the pattern is more clear and predcitable in this case, 
we can get more insights and better results from the models 
built on Lunisolar calendar approach like the Hindu 
Calendar. Considering the Gregorain Calendar approach, it 
shows rapid change in the temperature over the time and 
could not follow a predictable pattern.
